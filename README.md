3D_Printer
==========

This is an attempt to make a note page about the Rostock MAX 3D printer which we have setup.

Does not stick to bed.

Lifts from bed.

Not flat.
There are methods of leveling the bed. 
If the perimeter is thinner near one tower then turn the endstop clock wise. If it is thicker near the tower then turn the endstop counter (anti) clockwise. 
It it is too thin all over then the printer thinks the bed is closer than it is. Add 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 to the z height in the firmware.

Tips.
gcode cheat sheet added.
